### Project Title
Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

With this project, I am now more capable and confident in leveraging the power of Python to tell stories behind data. To be specific, I have improved my skills in using popular Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matlibplot) significantly when addressing this real-life business analysis project.

This project is to fulfill the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Programming for Datascience with Python".
